			<h3>Internship</h3>
            <h5>MORTEN INFO. AND COM. SERVICES INC. Aug 2023 – Sept 2023 </h5> 
			<p>For my first compulsory internship, my main field was networking and due to that, I studied Cisco CCNA classes. </p> 
			<p>During my internship, I immersed myself in networking concepts and technologies, starting with CCNA training on Udemy. </p> 
			<p>I learned about the OSI Reference Model, Cisco Systems, and configuring routers and switches. Routing techniques like OSPF and EIGRP were essential, as was VLAN routing for segmentation. </p> 
			<p>Security was a focus, with ACLs, NAT setups, and IPv6 addressing covered. I also delved into WAN technology and firewall installation. </p> 
			<p>Implementing QoS for network optimization was another key aspect. Overall, the internship provided hands-on experience and a solid foundation for a future career in IT networking</p>
